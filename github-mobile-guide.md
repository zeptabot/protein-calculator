# How to Use a GitHub Repo for Your Mobile App

When you find an application on GitHub that you want to use on your mobile phone, how you get it running depends entirely on what kind of application it is. Here’s a simple guide for beginners.

## Type 1: Web Apps (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

This is the most common and easiest type of app to run. If the app is a single `.html` file or a collection of web files, it’s a web app.

**How to run it:**
1.  **Find the Live Demo:** The best-case scenario is the developer has hosted the app online. Look for a link in the `README.md` or the repository description that says "Live Demo," "Website," or something similar.
2.  **Download and Open:** If there's no live link, you can run it yourself:
    - On the GitHub page, click the green `Code` button and select `Download ZIP`.
    - Unzip the file on your computer.
    - Find the main `.html` file (often `index.html` or, in your case, `protein_calculator.html`) and open it in a web browser on your phone or computer.
3.  **Add to Home Screen:** For an app-like experience on your phone, open the `.html` file in your mobile browser, tap the browser’s menu (the three dots or share icon), and select **"Add to Home Screen."**

**Repo Structure Advice:** You can keep a web app and its mobile-friendly version in the **same repository**. They are the same technology, just with a responsive design.

## Type 2: Native Mobile Apps (Android/iOS)

These are apps written in platform-specific languages (like Kotlin/Java for Android or Swift for iOS) or cross-platform frameworks (like React Native, Flutter, or Kivy).

### For Android Users (.apk file)
1.  **Find the `.apk` file:** Go to the repository’s **"Releases"** section (a tab near the top).
2.  **Download:** Look for a file ending in `.apk` in the latest release and download it to your phone.
3.  **Install:** Open the downloaded `.apk` file. Your phone will likely warn you about installing from "unknown sources." You’ll need to grant permission to proceed.
4.  **Run:** The app will now be installed on your phone like any other.

### For iOS Users

Unfortunately, this is much more difficult due to Apple's security policies. You generally cannot download and install an app directly from GitHub.

-   **App Store:** The developer must publish the app on the Apple App Store. Check the `README.md` for a link.
-   **TestFlight:** Developers might offer beta access through Apple's TestFlight app.
-   **Building from Source:** This is an advanced option that requires a Mac, Xcode (Apple's development software), and knowledge of how to compile and run code.

**Repo Structure Advice:** If you decide to build a native mobile app, you should create a **separate, new repository** for it. This keeps the web app code and native app code completely separate, which is much cleaner and easier to manage.
