### Feature Wishlist

I would love for community members to help build out these exciting new features:

1.  **Common Items Database:** Integrate a public food database (like the USDA FoodData Central, an open-source NUTTAB, or the Canadian Nutrient File) to allow users to quickly add common protein products without manual entry.

2.  **LLM-Powered Data Entry:** Integrate a Large Language Model (LLM) that can automatically parse and fill in the nutrition data by simply pasting the text from a product description (e.g., from an Amazon page).

3.  **Native Mobile App with OCR:** Develop a true native mobile app (for Android/iOS) that uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to scan nutrition labels in real-time with the phone's camera, making data entry instant and effortless.
