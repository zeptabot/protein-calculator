**Title:** Stop Getting Ripped Off by Protein Powders. I Built a Free Tool to Find the Cheapest Protein & Own the Economics of Your Diet.

**Post Body:**

Hey r/Fitness,

We all know the supplement industry is a minefield. Brands throw fancy labels, "advanced formulas," and premium prices at us, but at the end of the day, most of us just want one thing: effective protein that doesn't break the bank.

I got tired of doing mental gymnastics in the store, trying to figure out if the 5lb tub is actually a better deal than the 2lb bag once you account for serving size and protein content. It feels like we're being manipulated by marketing, not empowered by information.

So, I vibe-coded a tool to fight back.

**It's a dead-simple, no-BS Protein Cost Calculator.**

You plug in four numbers directly from the nutrition label:
1.  **Total Price** of the container
2.  **Total Weight** of the container (in grams)
3.  **Serving Size** (in grams)
4.  **Protein per Serving** (in grams)

The tool instantly tells you the **true cost per 30g of protein**. No more guesswork. Now you can compare every single product on the shelf and know, with certainty, which one gives you the most bang for your buck.

My vision is to build tools that empower us to optimize our health without falling victim to consumerism. This is the first step. It's completely free, open-source, and runs right in your browser.

### This is a Community Project - I Need Your Help!

This tool is just the beginning. I'm not a pro developer, but I have a vision for what this could become. If you're a coder, a data nerd, or just passionate about this stuff, I'd love for you to contribute.

Here's the wishlist:

*   **A "Common Items" Database:** Imagine just searching for "Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard" and having all the data auto-fill. We could integrate the USDA, NUTTAB, or Canadian food databases.
*   **LLM-Powered Data Entry:** What if you could just copy-paste the entire text from an Amazon product page, and an AI would intelligently find and plug in the right numbers?
*   **A True Mobile App with OCR:** The ultimate goal. A native mobile app where you just point your phone's camera at a nutrition label, and it instantly captures the data in real-time.

Let's build the tools we actually need to take control of our fitness journey.

Stop letting brands dictate your budget. Own the economics of your diet.
