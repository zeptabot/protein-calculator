**TikTok Video Script**

**(Video opens with a quick, dynamic shot of you at your computer, maybe with code on the screen. Upbeat, slightly rebellious music starts.)**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Are you tired of getting ripped off by protein companies?"

**(Cut to a screen recording or a shot of you pointing at a confusing nutrition label on a product.)**

**VOICEOVER:**
"They hit you with fancy labels and confusing serving sizes, making it impossible to know if you're actually getting a good deal."

**(Quick shot of you looking determined, then a fast-paced montage of you "working" on the project - typing, pointing at the screen.)**

**VOICEOVER:**
"I got sick of it. So I built this."

**(The screen shows a clean screen recording of your calculator on a mobile phone. Your finger guides the viewer's eye.)**

**VOICEOVER:**
"It's a dead-simple, free tool. No ads, no BS."

"You just enter four numbers straight from the label:"
"The price..."
"...the total weight..."
"...the serving size..."
"...and the protein per serving."

**(The calculator shows the final result. Zoom in dramatically on the "cost per 30g protein" number.)**

**VOICEOVER:**
"And it instantly tells you the TRUE cost per 30 grams of protein. Now you can compare everything and know who's *actually* the cheapest."

**(Cut back to you, speaking directly and passionately to the camera.)**

**VOICEOVER:**
"This is more than a calculator. It's a tool to fight back against consumerism and empower ourselves."

"And this is just the start. It's open-source, and I want to build a community to make it even crazier."

**(Quick, flashy text appears on screen for each feature as you say it.)**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Imagine a database of common foods..."
"...or using AI to read Amazon pages automatically..."
"...or the ultimate goal: using your phone's camera to scan nutrition labels in real-time!"

**(Final shot of you, looking at the camera with a visionary expression.)**

**VOICEOVER:**
"If you believe in this mission, find the project on GitHub. Let's build the tools to own the economics of our own health."
